<p>For high power laser cutting there are a number of additional options available to protect the machine especially from the laser beam which is not absorbed by the material being cut. These options are available in the "High Power" tab of the machine settings. The features are:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fast laser switch off: This option is used to switch off the laser beam quickly when the cutting head is moving over the sheet. This is useful when the laser beam is not absorbed by the material being cut and can damage the machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid pierce over slats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asyncronus motion to the conveyer belt</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If Vulcan works in the sync mode with Praxis then the nesting generation could be done with the actual positions of the slats on the machine, so the pierce points as well as cuts could be avoided over the contact points between the slats and the work piece.</p>
