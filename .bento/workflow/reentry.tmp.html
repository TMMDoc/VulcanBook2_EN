<p>Re-entry point allows the user to restart an interrupted program from a specific point. User can select the particular line in the DIN editor or directly select the segment in the drawing or use the “goto” option. Block input has the option of entering the line and block number manually in block input or by choosing the segment, it will update. Within the selected segment, the slider can be used to position the point, exactly from which the program has to be executed.</p>
