<div class="paragraph">
<p>A program consists of a program number, a number of blocks, and the end of program. Beginning of program and end of program represent the minimum contents of a program. A program may contain any number of blocks. The only limitation to the program size is the total memory size available. In addition to the (optional) block number, a block consists of a statement.
A statement contains the elements:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>preparatory function <strong>G</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>auxiliary function <strong>M, S, T</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high-speed outputs <strong>Q</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parameter assignments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arithmetic instruction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comment</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em><span class="underline">Points to remember:</span></em></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each element (G or M code) must be programmed only once in a block. <em>High-speed outputs</em> and <em>parameter assignment</em> are an exception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A block must have max. 256 characters. A block may also contain comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within a program, block numbers must be assigned in ascending order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A comment must be at the end of the block or stands on its own in a block and is delimited by parenthesis or, in case of arithmetic instructions, by braces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
