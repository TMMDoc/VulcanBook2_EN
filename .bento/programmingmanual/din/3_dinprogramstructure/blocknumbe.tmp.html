<p>Block numbers are optional. This means that each block can have a preceding block number assigned. Within a program, block numbers must be assigned in ascending order. Block numbers are only required for specifying a target block for program loops and/or branches. The blocks are executed in the programmed sequence.
For a block number, the numbers 0 &#8230;&#8203;65535 (= 2<sup>16</sup>-1) are allowed. This means that block numbers &gt; 65535 are interpreted possibly no more in a raising sequence but will be denied with a fault message.
