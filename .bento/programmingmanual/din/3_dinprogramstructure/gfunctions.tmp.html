<p>On principle, a DIN block with a G-function has the following structure. The letter G is followed by the number of the G-function. Then the parameters follow which are formed by their address letter and the respective value:
G(number) [address identifier (address value)]&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Example: G0 X0 Y0</em></strong>
All addresses may also be programmed indirectly as an alternative to the direct input. This is shown by the specification of P. The value of the parameter array of the specified index is assigned to the address letter instead of a numerical value.</p>
