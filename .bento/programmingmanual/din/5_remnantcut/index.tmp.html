<p>The remaining portion of a nested sheet can be cut and removed for easy handling of the jobs. In order to remove the remnant part, the cutting need to be started from outside the sheet and end beyond the sheet to make sure the part is completely removed from the jobs.

<div class="olist upperalpha">

<p>Start Remnant Cut</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End Remnant Cut</p>

</ol>
