<p><strong>Programming Use</strong>
Defines the Z position of the upper side of the sheet. Is used when cutting without active height regulation in order to define the position of the cutting head.
The theoretical Z position of the upper side of the sheet is assumed when work is done without TC_SHEET_THICK.
The measured Z position is taken into account for the next
TC_LASER_ON call with the laser methods 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The position of the laser cutting head is calculated by adding the measured value of TC_SHEET_THICK and of the nozzle distance from the technology table.
TC_SHEET_THICK:
■ Single-head mode must be selected in the laser cutting head table. Otherwise an error message will appear.
■ Is always called up with a program-specific laser technology table.
■ Takes effect with the next TC_LASER_ON call, which is programmed with one of the laser methods 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
■ Acts till the next TC_LASER_OFF call.
■ Deleted by M30 and RESET.
■ Machining of blanks.
■ Separation of waste grids.
