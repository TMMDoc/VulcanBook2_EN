<p><strong>Programming</strong>
With the TC_PROG_SECTION cycle call-up, jump labels within the NC text are defined for the following program parts:
■ Trimming cut (TC_PROG_SECTION(TRIMMING,X-Pos).
■ Contours (TC_PROG_SECTION(CONTOUR,X-Pos).
■ Separating cut (TC_PROG_SECTION(CUTOFF,X-Pos).
The multipart program structure can reduce the number of required programs. The previously required cutting and trimming program are integrated in the part program.
=
Program parts can be called up individually so that optimum tube loading is still possible. The individual program parts are selected and deselected via the production plan.
Multiple program structure: pre-cut part, trimming cut, contour, separating cut</p>
