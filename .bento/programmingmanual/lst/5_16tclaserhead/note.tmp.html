<p><strong>Programming</strong>
With the TC_LASER_HEAD cycle, the program-specific laser cutting head table is called up in the NC program. The laser cutting head table defines which cutting heads are active and with what distance (in X direction) both cutting heads move.
The TC_LASER_HEAD cycle is always linked with a programspecific laser cutting head table. Its content is transferred from the programming system to the control system using the NC program:
=
TC_LASER_HEAD ("Laser cutting head table")
■ Self-holding (modal) operation.
■ Must be programmed before the first travel motion and after TC_SHEET_LOAD.
■ Must always be programmed if head mode (single or twohead mode) or the distance of the cutting heads changes to each other.
■ Must be programmed in the NC program at all places where a program can be reentered.</p>

<p><sup>■</sup> The table is called up using <strong>LHT</strong> for <strong>L</strong>ASER <strong>H</strong>EAD <strong>T</strong>ABLE and a running number in the NC program; and must be specified in brackets with quotation marks, e.g. ("LHT-1").</p>
