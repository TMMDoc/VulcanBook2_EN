<p>The G822 function is allocated to a group of G commands. Only one G command may be used from this group within an NC block. The G commands belong to this group G820 – G829.
■ Is considered if automatic microjoints are activated or deactivated via the microjoint table. The table is called via TC_MICROJOINT ("table name").
■ Is not activated in the microjoint table as default. Standard: 0 = not activated; 1 = activated.
■ Can be written for the respective contour in a separate block or at the end of an NC block, but after TC_LASER_ON and before TC_LASER_OFF.
■ Is immediately effective after activation if the laser cutting head within the positioning motion is located between two contours. If the laser cutting head is, however, found directly at the machining of a contour, then the function only becomes effective for the next contour machining.
■ Should the function be deactivated when a contour is being machined, then another microjoint will be set in this contour. The following contour is machined without a microjoint. If the machining head is found between two contours within a positioning motion, then the following contour will be machined without a microjoint.
■ Is cleared with the next TC_LASER_OFF.</p>
