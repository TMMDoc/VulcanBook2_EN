<p><strong>Definition</strong> Skipping automatic microjoint in relation to the contour.
The criteria for an automatically set microjoint at the end of a contour is the dimension of the contour in X- and Y-direction. If the maximum dimension of the contour in X- or Y-direction lies within a range also defined in the microjoint table, then a microjoint is automatically set at the end of every contour.
Because the control system cannot differentiate between closed and open contours, every open contour must already be marked as such in the programming system. Otherwise, microjoints will also be set at open contours, i.e. these open contours will be shortened.
With G function G822, unwanted, automatic microjoints can now be skipped on the control.</p>
