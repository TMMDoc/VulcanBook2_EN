<p><strong>Definition</strong> Defining programmable, contour related microjoints.
With this G function, the NC block within the contour is marked by setting a microjoint. The microjoint can be set within the contour or at the end of the contour.
If the microjoint is set within the contour, then piercing is automatically renewed.</p>

<p><strong>Programming Example</strong>
Restrictions for microjoints within the contour:
■ Special forms of piercing, such as the "back-step", for example, are not supported. This is due to the approach procedure not being possible afterwards in the contour.
■ Approaching with reduced cutting parameters and subsequent switching to normal parameters is not possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note</strong>
Depending on the machine, special shapes are possible via the TC_LEAD_IN cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>
The G821 function is assigned to a group of G commands. Only one G command may be used from this group within an NC block. The G commands belong to this group G820 – G829.
Is considered if programmed microjoints are activated or deactivated via the microjoint table.
Is not activated in the microjoint table as default.
Standard: 0 = not activated; 1 = activated.
Is written into the contour&#8217;s NC block, at the end of which the microjoint is to be set.
Is immediately effective after activation if the laser cutting head within the positioning motion is located between two contours. If the laser cutting head is, however, found directly at the machining of a contour, then the function only becomes effective for the next contour machining.
Should the function be deactivated when a contour is being machined, then another microjoint will be set in this contour. The following contour is machined without a microjoint. If the machining head is found between two contours within a positioning motion, then the following contour will be machined without a microjoint.
