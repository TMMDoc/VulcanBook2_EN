With the TC_FOCUS_OFFSET cycle call-up the focal position setting can be changed by an adjustment value during machining. In this way an optimum focal position setting is possible both for the approach to the contour and for contour machining.
TC_FOCUS_OFFSET_ON:
=
■ The adjustment value is read out from the active laser technology table via the parameter "focus offset".
■ The parameter "focus offset" contains positive or negative values in mm.
■ With TC_FOCUS_OFFSET_OFF the adjustment value is deactivated during the machining.
