<p><strong>Laser method</strong>
Depending on the parameters entered, the following machine commands are executed with the TC_LASER_OFF cycle call-up:
■ Switch off the laser beam.
■ Switch off the cutting gas.
■ Position the Z axis.
The TC_LASER_OFF cycle is called up with a cycle parameter in the NC program:
TC_LASER_OFF(Laser method)
The following TC_LASER_OFF cycles are available:</p>

<p><strong>Functions</strong>
|1 | a|
Beam OFF, Z axis at overshoot height (standard overshoot height = 40 mm).
|2 | a|
Beam OFF, high voltage OFF, Z axis at home position.
|3 | a|
Corresponds to method 1.
|4 | a|
Beam OFF, Z axis remains at processing clearance (at piercing height for the following piercings / at cutting height for the following cuts).
|6 | a|
In the case of RotoLas: Laser beam OFF, Z axis to overtravel height (in relation to the outside diameter).
|10 | a|
Beam OFF, preparation for hard Microweld.
|11 | a|
Beam OFF, preparation for soft Microweld.

The laser methods are used as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>■ If <strong>Laser method 1</strong> is programmed, the overtravel height which the Z axis is to approach must previously be programmed with TC_POS_LEVEL (TruLaser series 7000: the cutting heads taking part in the cutting process). This method is used to switch off the laser beam after a processed part and to position the next part.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>■ <strong>Laser method 2</strong> is used to switch off the laser beam at the end of part programming and to move the Z axis to the home position.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><sup>■</sup> <strong>Laser method 3</strong> corresponds to <strong>Laser method 1</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>■ <strong>Laser method 4</strong> is used for "common cuts" processing and for SprintLine. Under no circumstances may a hole or formed section be moved over during positioning.</p>
