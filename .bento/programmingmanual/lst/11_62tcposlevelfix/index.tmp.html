<p><strong>Definition</strong> The TC_POS_LEVEL_FIX cycle defines in a cross-program manner how far the cutting head pulls back during cross over.

The cutting head moves to the position of sheet surface plus overtravel height when the laser beam is switched off with TC_LASER_OFF(1) or (3).</p>

<p><strong>Programming</strong> TC_POS_LEVEL_FIX(Overshoot height)
■ Self-holding (modal) operation.
■ Becomes effective with TC_LASER_OFF(1) or (3).
■ Overwrites TC_POS_LEVEL.
■ If TC_POS_LEVEL_FIX is not programmed, the Z axis at
TC_LASER_OFF(1) approaches the values defined by TC_POS_LEVEL.</p>
