<p><strong>Laser method</strong>
With the TC_LASER_ON cycle call-up, the following machine commands are executed independently of the entered cycle parameters:
■ Switch on the distance regulation system.
■ Select piercing gas.
■ Move Z axis to piercing position.
■ Switch on beam for piercing.
■ Select the cutting gas.
■ Move Z axis to cutting position.
■ Switch on beam for cutting.
■ Select focal position.
■ Select beam diameter.
■ Select laser power.
TC_LASER_ON (Laser method,"Technology table",piercing type,cutting type)
■ The parameters of the technology table for TC_LASER_ON for different materials and material thicknesses are available at the machine control. The name of the suitable technology table must be specified at the time of programming.
■ If pure cutting or piercing cycles are called up, the value "0" must be entered for the cycle parameter "Piercing type" or "Cutting type".
■ Is deleted by TC_LASER_OFF.

<p><strong>Cutting type</strong> Cycle parameters: Data is selected from the active technology table via the cutting type. Cutting data (e. g. laser output, cutting and approach parameters) is stored there for different machining requirements. Differences are as follows:
■ Size, medium or small contour.
■ Normal or reduced cutting speed.
■ Normal or reduced acceleration values.
The cutting type is selected using a three-digit number, whereby each digit has a particular significance:</p>

With laser methods 5 or 11 and 6 or 12, cutting with "floating data exchange" can be programmed. If a further
TC_LASER_ON instance is programmed with methods 5 or 11
and 6 or 12 and the beam has already been ignited, switching over can be done as follows:
■ Switch among the various cutting data within a technology table (e. g. due to a contour change).
■ Switch among the various technology tables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No axis stop is necessary in case of modifications of laser power and gating frequency as well as for minor modifications of cutting parameters such as gas pressure, gating frequency, and cutting distance. The switch will be made to the new parameters <strong>during the machining</strong>.
■ No pits due to reduction of the cutting speed during data exchange.
■ Faster processing due to "floating data exchange".</p>
