<p>Usually the most frequent problem with KL59 is the mal-function of Faulhaber focus motor.</p>

<li>
<p>After the focus motor replacing, service firstly needs to evaluate whether the focus motor is properly assembled (the relative position of the zero mark impulse with respect to the reference switch: target value is around 500~1000).</p>

<p>And now the coding in codesys is done and tested in sub-program RefAdjust. This new program needs to be integrated into Vulcan: a SW button on HMI which can only be accessed by service should be added. And this measuring program can be executed by pressing this SW button. After program execution, the measured relative position can be returned onto HMI so that the service can evaluate and decide whether mechanical re-adjustment is necessary.</p>

<li>
<p>After focus motor replacing, the focus offset of the new assembly needs to be measured and then recorded as the new parameter for Vulcan and Focus motor&#8217;s drive parameter.</p>
