<p>This helps to detect the work piece according to the material and thickness of the sheet along with nozzle to calibrate the height between workpiece and nozzle in order to avoid collision while cutting is active.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 16 steps to calibrate the height sensor. Initially, once the program calls, the Nozzle from the height of the actual position touches the workpiece and moves upward to 20mm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then it goes downwards 16mm, 14mm, 12mm, 10mm, 8mm, 6mm, 5mm, 4mm, 3.6mm, 3mm, 2.4mm, 2mm, 1.4mm, 1mm, 0.4mm respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When it reaches 0.4mm, it goes back again to the 20mm of the Z-axis. The stroke of the Z-axis is 115mm.</p>
