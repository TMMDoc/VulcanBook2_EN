<div class="paragraph">
<p>This page displays the state of the PLC keys. When the user clicks a PLC key, the UI will be updated based on the acknowledgement from PLC. The PLC keys are assigned fixed text numbers. Numbers 2800-2899 and 2900-2999 are reserved for this purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Example Key assignments to text numbers:</div>
<p>Key0 (first button) 2800,2900<br>
Key1 (second button) 2801,2901</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If both texts are present in the text file, the key is available as a switch. If only the first text number is present in the text file (e.g. 2801, but not 2901), the key is available as a button. In data block 1 in the PLC, the HMI signals whether a button or switch was pressed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following rules apply:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a button (only one text is defined, the second text is missing), the status is displayed as pressed (1) and not (0).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a switch (both texts are defined), the status is not displayed as pressed and not pressed. Instead, the relevant bit is toggled accordingly each time you press and release the switch</p>
</li>
</ul>
