<p>The protective glass monitoring is a system that monitors the condition of the protective glass. I could prevent you to produce parts of low quality or even damage the machine. T</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The behavior is defined as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When Quality value of the protective glass&lt; error level during cutting:
Machine processing will stop and beam off and then pop out a window at the front of the HMI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If clickthe“Close” button of the window, then the machine will continue cutting the current whole sheet, then before process next sheet it will do a protective glass measurement then if the quality is lower than error level, it will pop out this window again. Click
“Close” and process again then at the end of the sheet it will pop out this window again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If theglass is contaminated at the beginning then after cutting the first contour, processing will
stop and do a protective glass measurement then if the quality is lower than error level, it will pop out a
window. If click the “Close” button of the window, then the machine will continue cutting the current
whole sheet</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a offline measurement and a online measurement possible:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>offline</strong>:  the Offline measurement will be done in the following cases</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start of the first program after the machine power ON equivalent to "Laser Standby" button pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During online measurement, if found glass contaminated or contamination possible then will do it at the start of every program until the glass is Clean</p>
</li>
</ul>
