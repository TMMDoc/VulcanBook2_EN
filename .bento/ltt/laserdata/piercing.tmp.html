<h2 id="_normal_piercing">Normal piercing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Normal piercing is optimized for fast, reliable processing.
The beam remains ignited until the end of the piercing time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advantages: "Normal piercing" depending on the gas type:
* Oxygen: Start hole is produced with minimal time delay.
* Nitrogen: Producing the start hole with nitrogen prevents formation of oxides when starting to cut</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="_gentle_piercing">Gentle piercing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Gentle piercing" usually takes a little longer than normal piercing; however, it delivers better quality piercing results.
* Defined settings possible in combination with a ramp.
* Minimal amount of slag or molten metal being thrown up.
* When cutting small contours in stainless steel, a start hole is produced with a small amount of material. This reduces nozzle wear and the increase process reliability.</p>

<h2 id="_multistage_piercing">Multistage piercing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Piercing with up to 3 independent piercing parameter sets. This makes possible pre-treatment and refinishing of the piercing possible, which means, for example that the amount of thrown-up material around the piercing can be greatly reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Area of application: material thicknesses from 10 mm in mild steel, stainless steel and aluminum.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_pierceline_piercing_sensor">PierceLine piercing sensor</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Safety margins have been added to the piercing time in the cutting tables to ensure process reliability. This is necessary above all because the shortest possible piercing time varies depending on the technology, with variation as follows:
* From piercing to piercing.
* Depending on the quality of the material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The piercing-end is detected by the piercing sensor, PierceLine, and the piercing process is ended as soon as the material is completely cut through. Thusconsiderably reducing the piercing time.</p>
