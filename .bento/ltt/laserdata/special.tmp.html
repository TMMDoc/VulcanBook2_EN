<p>When laser cutting sheet metal, it may be necessary not to cut parts completely free, but to secure them to the sheet metal or the scrap skeleton.</p>

<p>Microjoints are created by switching the laser beam off for a certain period of time during the cutting process and then back on again. Meanwhile, the cutting head continues to follow the contour. Due to this interruption, a bridge with the entire sheet thickness
remains on the contour path.</p>

<h3 id="_nanojoint">Nanojoint</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nanojoints specifically create small connections on the under side of the sheet between the cut part and the scrap skeleton. During the cutting process, the laser power is reduced by a certain value for a short period of time so that the sheet metal is not completely severed. After a defined period of time, the laser power is increased again and the cut is continued. This leaves a small connection between the cut part and the scrap skeleton on the underside of the sheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre> ■ The process does not add time during the cutting process
and therefore does not affect productivity.
 ■ Due to the small dimensions of a nanojoint, the parts can be
easily removed or pulled out.</pre>
