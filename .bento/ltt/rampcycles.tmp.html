<p>For quality piercings Laser Ramp Cycles are used to control the laser power during the piercing process. In ramp mode, a start hole for laser cutting can be produced in a low-impact manner. To do this, the laser power and the gating frequency are controlled via a programmed interval. This piercing process prevents damage to the focusing optics and ensures that uncontrolled burning away of material does not occur.</p>

<p>The ramp will only be shown graphically in the user interface for a maximum of 100 s. Longer ramps will however still run as defined. The laser&#8217;s power, times and gating frequency must be adjusted for the material&#8217;s type and thickness.</p>
