<h2 id="_normal_piercing">Normal piercing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Normal piercing is optimized for fast, reliable processing.
The beam remains ignited until the end of the piercing time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advantages: "Normal piercing" depending on the gas type:
* Oxygen: Start hole is produced with minimal time delay.
* Nitrogen: Producing the start hole with nitrogen prevents formation of oxides when starting to cut</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_gentle_piercing">Gentle piercing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Gentle piercing" usually takes a little longer than normal piercing; however, it delivers better quality piercing results.
* Defined settings possible in combination with a ramp.
* Minimal amount of slag or molten metal being thrown up.
* When cutting small contours in stainless steel, a start hole is produced with a small amount of material. This reduces nozzle wear and the increase process reliability.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_multistage_piercing">Multistage piercing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Piercing with up to 3 independent piercing parameter sets. This makes possible pre-treatment and refinishing of the piercing possible, which means, for example that the amount of thrown-up material around the piercing can be greatly reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Area of application: material thicknesses from 10 mm in mild steel, stainless steel and aluminum.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_pierceline_piercing_sensor">PierceLine piercing sensor</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Safety margins have been added to the piercing time in the cutting tables to ensure process reliability. This is necessary above all because the shortest possible piercing time varies depending on the technology, with variation as follows:
* From piercing to piercing.
* Depending on the quality of the material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The piercing-end is detected by the piercing sensor, PierceLine, and the piercing process is ended as soon as the material is completely cut through. Thusconsiderably reducing the piercing time.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_approach_strategies">Approach strategies</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to avoid damage to the contour from piercing, the material is pierced a few millimeters to one side of the contour. The contour is then approached using various strategies depending on the material, the material thickness and the contour size.
=== Normal approach
With a normal approach, cutting takes place straight from the start hole with the cutting parameters from the appropriate cutting table.
=== Reduced approaching
The contour is approached at a reduced speed. Power, frequency, nozzle distance</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_approach_with_pre_cut">Approach with pre-cut</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After piercing, a cut of a few millimeters is made at reduced speed, depending on material thickness. The cutting head then returns to the start hole using the last active positioning speed and the contour is then approached and cut with the parameters from the appropriate cutting table.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_cooling_after_approach">Cooling after approach</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For "Cooling after approach", the laser beam is switched off briefly after the approach before the actual contour is cut. The cutting gas, however, continues to flow and cools the processing point.</p>

<h2 id="_marking_and_dot_marking">Marking and dot marking</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Material parts are marked by a change in color on the material surface. The marking can normally no longer be felt after enameling or painting since only a minimum of material is removed.</p>

<h4 id="_contour_sizes">Contour sizes</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <strong>TRUMPF’s</strong> CNC programming and laser cutting context, the concepts of <strong>large, medium, and small contours</strong> relate to the size and complexity of different geometric features in a cutting or machining process. These distinctions help optimize tool movement, cutting strategies, and processing speed.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_1_large_contours"><strong>1. Large Contours</strong></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Large contours refer to <strong>long, continuous cuts</strong> or <strong>outer profiles</strong> of a part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are usually <strong>primary</strong> cutting paths that define the external shape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Straight or smoothly curved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fewer interruptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be cut at <strong>higher speeds</strong> since there’s less risk of thermal buildup or precision loss.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2_medium_contours"><strong>2. Medium Contours</strong></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Medium-sized features inside or along the part, such as <strong>large cutouts, holes, or slots</strong>.</p>

<li>
<p>These are more complex than large contours but not as intricate as small contours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May require adjustments in cutting speed due to moderate detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need some level of <strong>precision</strong> control to maintain accuracy.</p>

<li>
<p>Can influence heat dissipation and material behavior.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_3_small_contours"><strong>3. Small Contours</strong></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>These refer to <strong>detailed, intricate cuts</strong> such as <strong>small holes, fine patterns, or sharp corners</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cutting small contours requires <strong>higher precision</strong> and <strong>slower speeds</strong> to maintain accuracy and avoid defects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often involve <strong>tight radii, intricate shapes, or densely packed cut areas</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prone to <strong>thermal effects</strong> (melting, burrs, material distortion).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May require <strong>adaptive strategies</strong> like reduced power, fine nozzle control, or micro-joint techniques.</p>

<h3 id="_flyline">FlyLine</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FlyLine is a machining strategy that can help to save a consider able amount of time when machining certain sheet types. FlyLine is especially effective for hole grids.
* Laser beam is switched on and off on-the-fly with a high degree of position accuracy. The axes are not stopped when the laser beam is switched on and off.
* Individual contours that are not on one line are split up into axis-parallel contour sections. This makes it possible to avoid corner machining. The speed is reduced only for the few changes in direction</p>

<h2 id="_securing_cut_parts_in_place">Securing cut parts in place</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When laser cutting sheet metal, it may be necessary not to cut parts completely free, but to secure them to the sheet metal or the scrap skeleton.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_microjoint">Microjoint</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Microjoints create small bridges between the part that has been cut free and the scrap skeleton.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Microjoints are created by switching the laser beam off for a certain period of time during the cutting process and then back on again. Meanwhile, the cutting head continues to follow the contour. Due to this interruption, a bridge with the entire sheet thickness
remains on the contour path.</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>■ The process requires rework.
■ The process is suitable for thin to medium-thick sheets.
■ The process takes a certain amount of time.</pre>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_nanojoint">Nanojoint</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nanojoints specifically create small connections on the under side of the sheet between the cut part and the scrap skeleton. During the cutting process, the laser power is reduced by a certain value for a short period of time so that the sheet metal is not completely severed. After a defined period of time, the laser power is increased again and the cut is continued. This leaves a small connection between the cut part and the scrap skeleton on the underside of the sheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre> ■ The process does not add time during the cutting process
and therefore does not affect productivity.
 ■ Due to the small dimensions of a nanojoint, the parts can be
easily removed or pulled out.</pre>
