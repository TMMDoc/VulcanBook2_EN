<p>In this section we will discuss best practises to increase the accuracy of the laser cutting process. The following options are available to increase the accuracy of the laser cutting process:</p>

<p>Path correction
 If the laser cut followed exactly the drawn cutting path, a con
tour error would occur due to the given width of the kerf -
exactly by half the width of the kerf.
 The smaller the contour, the greater the error or the effect, pro
portionally speaking.
 The machine can compensate for this error by means of an
automatic path correction. The kerf is offset half the width so
that the boundary of the kerf is aligned with the contour</p>
