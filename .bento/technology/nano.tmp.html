<p>Laser nano joints are a type of advanced joining technology that utilizes laser beams to create a precise and strong connections which is reduced in depth. They speed up the process because it is so much faster to produce tiny retaining points rather than conventional micro tabs during cutting. They also allow the operator to break parts free from the nest with much less effort. This saves time and makes life easier for workers. In most cases, nano joints also completely eliminate the need for finishing work, since the mark they leave when the parts are broken free from the nest is barely visible. In contrast, micro joints leave much more obvious contour damage which subsequently has to be manually corrected by production staff.</p>
